# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a type of formatting that can be used with a number of different platforms, including blogs, wikis, and forums. It simplifies the task of creating formatted content by using plain text, which can then be easily converted into HTML.

# How does Markdown work?

In Markdown, formatting is added by adding specific characters before and after the text that you want to format. For example, to create a heading, add ** before and after the text. To create a list, add * before and after each item. There are many different formatting options available in Markdown, and you can find a full list on the website http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.

Headings:  To create a heading, add ** before and after the text. For example,  **This is a heading** .
2. Paragraphs:  Just like in regular text, paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
3. Italics: To create italics, add * (asterisk) before and after the text. For example, *italic text* .   4. Bold: To create bold text, add ** (double asterisks) before and after the text. For example, **bold text** .
